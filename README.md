# Game-Template

This is the default template we use when starting a new project.

To build the game, run the `build.bat` batch script located under the `Tools` directory. The game will be compiled into the `CurrentBuild.rbxlx` file in the root of the repository. 
You can then open the file with studio and live-sync in your code changes.

# Requirements
